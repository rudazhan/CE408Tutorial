# CE408Tutorial

Tutorial material for CE408, Fall 2016.

Source code for each weekly tutorial, if using R, will be put in the [tutorial](./tutorial) directory. 

## Use RStudio!

RStudio is *THE* integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming.
R distributions typically only ship with a bare-bone command line interface; while RStudio is a graphical user interface with many tools that makes R programming much easier.

RStudio has a free desktop version, you can [download the current version from its website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

For your convenience, here's a list of download links for RStudio Desktop 0.99.903:

- [For Windows Vista/7/8/10](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-0.99.903.exe)
- [For Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-0.99.903.dmg)
- [For Ubuntu 12.04+/Debian 8+ (64-bit)](https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.99.903-amd64.deb)

## Resources

The [resources](./resources) directory has some useful notes I've written on R.

[R.md](./resources/R.md) is a helpful reference on the syntax and semantics of R.
The essence of R as a programming language is that: 
> Everything that exists is an object.
> Everything that happens is a function call.
> â€” John Chambers

[R-base.md](./resources/R-base.md) lists useful functions in **base R**, the core packages that ships with every R distribution.
Remembering function names (and its common usage) is a core part of learning R, so you'd better have a good vocabulary of base R.
