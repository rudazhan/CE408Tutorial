# CE408Tutorial

Tutorial material for CE408, Fall 2016.

Source code for each weekly tutorial, if using R, will be put in the [tutorial](./tutorial) directory. 

## Resources

The [resources](./resources) directory has some useful notes I've written on R.

[R.md](./resources/R.md) is a helpful reference on the syntax and semantics of R.
The essence of R as a programming language is that: 
> Everything that exists is an object.
> Everything that happens is a function call.
> â€” John Chambers

[R-base.md](./resources/R-base.md) lists useful functions in **base R**, the core packages that ships with every R distribution.
Remembering function names (and its common usage) is a core part of learning R, so you'd better have a good vocabulary of base R.
